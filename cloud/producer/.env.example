# Optional: bucket and fuse flags for Cloud Storage mounting
# NOTE: The producer does not require storage by default. These vars are provided
# for consistency with the consumer. If you run the producer with any local
# processing that needs persistence, you may mount a bucket similarly.
# - GCS_BUCKET: name of the bucket you would mount
# - ENABLE_GCS_FUSE: set to true only if you explicitly use gcsfuse

# Local vs Cloud Run
# - Local: run consumer on localhost:8080; set CONSUMER_BASE_URL accordingly.
# - Cloud Run: point CONSUMER_BASE_URL to the private HTTPS URL of the consumer
#   service and rely on IAM (omit SERVICE_AUTH_TOKEN), or set an agreed dev token.
